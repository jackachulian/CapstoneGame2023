Friend: You okay?

Protag: Well... I feel really panicked right now. I’m shaking and I can’t stop worrying about this presentation. I can’t do this. I’m scared! I want to ask for your help. Do you know how I can calm down?

Friend: I’m glad you said something to me! Talking about your feelings to a friend is a good start! I’m always here to listen and give you support. 

Protag: But I’m so nervous, I can’t even think straight!

Friend: You’re going to do great on this presentation! You got this! I know it seems hard right now, but there are some things that you can do to help yourself calm down. 

Take your time. Ask yourself what you need right now. I believe in you! Have you tried breathing exercises or writing in your journal?
