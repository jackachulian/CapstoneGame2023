Friend: Hey! Are you ready for the presentation this hour?

Protag: Ready? No way... I was so worried about it that I couldn’t sleep last night.
I can’t stop thinking about what might go wrong!

Friend: What do you mean?

Protag: Well…
When I think about standing in front of the class to present, my heart starts beating faster and my hands start to shake… I’m so nervous, it’s getting hard to even breathe…

Teacher: I'll give you some time to prepare, but you all must be ready to present today.  

Protag: I’m not ready! All I want to do is run away... I’m sweating and I can’t think straight!! What if I forget what to say?
I can feel my heart pounding in my chest... My breathing is getting faster... I feel panicked and scared… What should I do?


Protag: It’s hard to ask for help, but I know I need to talk to someone... I should talk to my friend about how I feel...

Friend: You okay?

Protag: Well... I feel really panicked right now. I’m shaking and I can’t stop worrying about this presentation. I can’t do this. I’m scared! I want to ask for your help. Do you know how I can calm down?

Friend: I’m glad you said something to me! Talking about your feelings to a friend is a good start! I’m always here to listen and give you support. 

Protag: But I’m so nervous, I can’t even think straight!

Friend: You’re going to do great on this presentation! You got this! I know it seems hard right now, but there are some things that you can do to help yourself calm down. 

Take your time. Ask yourself what you need right now. I believe in you! Have you tried breathing exercises or writing in your journal?
